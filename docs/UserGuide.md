DSAce is a **desktop app for creating flashcards and practising quiz questions for CS2040s, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DSAce can get your revision done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `dsace.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the DSAce app.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. <br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui1.png)

   **NOTE:** DSAce is used for storing flashcards that have a name, definition, tags, and priority level. Whenever the app is started up, the user will not be able to view the definitions of all the flashcards. This is
   so that the flashcards can be used as practice for remembering CS2040S definitions. Hence, in order to view or hide the definitions, the user must use the flashcard flip feature. To learn more about this
   feature, go to this [section](#flipping-a-flashcard--flip).

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all flashcards.

   * **`add`**`n/Insertion Sort d/Worse case: O(n^2)` : Adds a flashcard named `Insertion Sort` to the current list.

   * **`edit`**`1 n/BubbleSort d/Average case: O(n^2)` : Edits the name and definition of the first flashcard in the
   current list to be `BubbleSort` and `Average case: O(n^2)` respectively.

   * **`sort`**`desc` : Sorts all flashcards by descending order of priority.

   * **`find`**`n/Heap` : Finds flashcards with names containing the keyword `Heap`.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the third flashcard shown in the current list.

   * **`flip`**`2` : Flips the second flashcard shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all flashcards.

   * **`enter quiz`** : Enters Quiz mode.

      * **`start attempt`** : Starts a new quiz attempt. (command is only valid in the quiz interface)

      * **`answer`** `1 a/true` : Answers the first quiz question. (command is only valid in the quiz interface)

      * **`end attempt`**: Ends the current quiz attempt. (command is only valid in the quiz interface)

   * **`leave quiz`** : Leaves Quiz mode.

   * **`performance`** : Enters the performance window.

     * **`view`** `1` : Views the results of the first quiz attempt. (command is only valid in the performance interface)

     * **`list`** : Lists the results of all past quiz attempts. (command is only valid in the performance interface)

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the three features below for details of each command.

7. All flashcards and data on past quiz attempts will be stored in the home folder.

The DSAce app consists of three distinct interfaces. The first interface is the flashcard interface, where the user can access flashcard-related functionality.
An example of how the flashcard interface appears is shown in the image below.

![flashcard interface](images/interface1.png)

The second interface is the quiz interface, where the user can attempt quiz questions. An example of how the quiz interface appears is
shown in the image below. Note that the quiz question list cannot be modified by the user.

![quiz interface](images/interface2.png)

The third interface is the performance interface, where the user can view the results of past quiz attempts. An example of how the performance interface appears
is shown in the image below. Note that the performance interface can be accessed using two different methods: firstly, by entering the `performance` command in either
the flashcard or quiz interface, and secondly, by clicking on the `performance` option in the top menu bar of either the flashcard or quiz interface.

![performance interface](images/interface3.png)

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Listed below are three separate sets of commands for the flashcard, quiz, and performance interfaces. Unless explicitly stated, a command for a particular interface
  will not work in another interface.
 <br> eg: add n/name d/definition cannot be used in the quiz and performance interfaces. <br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters that must be specified by the user. <br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter.

* Parameters enclosed in square brackets are optional. <br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME [t/HIGH]`, `HIGH` is an optional parameter.

* Parameters can be in any order. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DEFINITION`, `d/DEFINITION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Commands are case-sensitive unless stated otherwise.

</div>

## Flashcard interface
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
* Only commands listed in this section are valid in the flashcard interface.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Opens up a help window containing a link to the user guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Adding a flashcard : `add`

Adds a flashcard to the home folder.

Format: `add n/NAME d/DEFINITION [t/TAG] [p/PRIORITY]`

Examples:
* `add n/Bellman Ford Search d/runtime: O(VE) p/high`
* `add n/Bubble Sort d/runtime: O(n^2) t/sorting t/midterm`

Note:
- Names should only contain alphanumeric spaces and characters, and they should not be blank e.g. `n/breadth-first search` is not allowed.
- Multiple flashcards with the same name are not allowed e.g. `n/Quicksort` is not allowed if there already exists a flashcard with the name `Quicksort`.
- If duplicate tags are specified, only one tag will be added e.g. if `t/sorting t/sorting` is specified, the flashcard will have only one tag with the label `sorting`.
- If multiple tags are added, `t/` must be specified for each and every tag e.g. `t/sorting t/midterm`
- If the priority is not specified, it will be low by default.
- If there are multiple instances of name and/or definition, the one that appears last is taken
- For `name`, `definition`, and `priority`, if there are multiple arguments specified, the last argument will be taken e.g. if `n/Quicksort n/Slowsort d/sort quickly d/sort slowly p/low p/high` is specified,
  the flashcard will have name `Slowsort`, definition `sort slowly`, and priority `high`.

### Listing all flashcards : `list`

Shows a list of all flashcards in the home folder.

Format: `list`

### Sorting all flashcards : `sort`

Sorts all flashcards in the home folder by priority.

Format: `sort [ORDER]`

Note:
* `asc` is specified to sort the flashcards in ascending order of priority i.e. flashcards with `low` priority are displayed
   at the top of the list, and flashcards with `high` priority are displayed at the bottom of the list.
* `desc` is specified to sort the flashcards in descending order of priority i.e. flashcards with `high` priority are displayed
   at the top of the list, and flashcards with `low` priority are displayed at the bottom of the list.
* The order is case-insensitive. e.g `ASC` and `AsC` will both sort in ascending order of priority.
* If no order is specified, the default order is ascending.

Examples:
* `sort ASC` sorts all flashcards in ascending order of priority.
* `sort desc` sorts all flashcards in descending order of priority.

### Editing a flashcard : `edit`

Edits an existing flashcard in the home folder.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DEFINITION] [t/TAG] [p/PRIORITY]`

* Edits the flashcard at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number associated with the edited flashcard, as shown in the displayed flashcard list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the flashcard will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the flashcard’s tags by typing t/ without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `edit 1 n/BubbleSort d/Average case: O(n^2)` edits the name and definition of the 1st flashcard to
   be `BubbleSort` and `Average case: O(n^2)` respectively.
* `list` followed by `edit 2 n/SelectionSort t/` edits the name of the 2nd flashcard to be `SelectionSort` and clears
 all existing tags.
* `list` followed by `edit 3 p/high` edits the priority of the 3rd flashcard to be `high`.

Note:
- To edit multiple tags, each of them requires its own label e.g `t/sorting t/midterm`
- If there are multiple instances of name and/or definition, the one that appears last is taken
  e.g second will be the name of `n/first n/second`

### Locating flashcards by name/tag/priority: `find`

Finds flashcards with names, tags or priorities containing any of the given keywords.

Format: find `[n/KEYWORD]​` `[t/KEYWORD]​` `[p/KEYWORD]​`

* All `find` operations are done on the original flashcards list which contains all flashcards.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `sort` will match `Sort`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `runtime sort` will match `sort runtime`
* Names, tags or priorities will be searched according to input prefixes.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `sort` will not match `sorting`
* Only flashcards matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).

Examples:

* `find n/Quicksort` returns `Quicksort`
* `find n/Chaining t/hashing` returns `Chaining`
* `find n/Heap p/medium` returns `Heaps`
