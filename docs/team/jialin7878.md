## Project: AddressBook Level 3

DSAce is a desktop definition book application used for teaching Data Structures and Algorithms principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for find command to search for tags and priority.
  * What it does: allows the user to search for flashcards using tags and priority keywords as well. Multiple keywords will follow the `AND` search
  i.e only flashcards that fulfills all keywords will be returned
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience because the user can revise flashcards by topic (e.g Sorting) and/or by priority (e.g priority: high)
  * Highlights: The implementation required changes to existing commands, as well as the creation of three new predicate classes.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=jialin7878&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
