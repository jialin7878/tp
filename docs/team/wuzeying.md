## Project: DSAce (AddressBook Level 3)

DSAce is a desktop definition book application used for teaching Data Structures and Algorithms principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Priority
  * What it does: Allows users to assign priority of the flashcards. Users can sort the flashcards by priority.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to see which concept should be of their priority. Hence, easing their process of revision.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands such add and edit.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added enter quiz and leave quiz command
  * What it does: Allows users to enter quiz and leave quiz interface
  * Justification: This feature allows users to enter a separate interface where flashcards are removed, quiz questions are shown and interface color scheme changes.
  * Highlights: NA
